# RayTracing
Practicing with Ray Tracing Technology Using C++

This project has helped me better understand how to use C++ in terms of creating actual software. I recommend anyone who wants to learn C++ and how ray tracing technology works to follow the guide below. It has also helped me brush up on linear algebra concepts! I want to personally thank Steve Hollasch as he has helped answer my questions on this topic.
