## Practicing with Ray Tracing Technology Using C++

This project has helped me better understand how to use C++ in terms of creating actual software. I recommend anyone who wants to learn C++ and how ray tracing technology works to follow the guides below. This has also helped me brush up on linear algebra concepts! I want to personally thank Steve Hollasch as he has helped answer my questions on this topic.

## Why is There Different Folders and/or Files with the Same Name but Different Version Numbers?

When working on this project I typically found that new code was being built on top of old code and that the old code itself was being improved for efficiency. I wanted to record each iteration where there was a drastic step in the code. Since drastic is rather subjective, I went with my own intuition on what constitued a new "version". I found that this way of recording what I had done has allowed me to go back, look at old code and understand the intution behind the new code and new concepts being presented in each of the books. The top folders, RayTracingV1, RayTracingV2, and RayTracingV3 represent the 3 different books on topic. Within these folders there are typically a few different versions as I have progressed through the book and learned new techniques, each of these versions will have their own separate folder. The highest version number will be the finished ray tracer.
